# Variables can be a string (note speech marks)
greeting = "hello world"

# Variables can be a number
fav_num = 7
num_string = "5" # Speech marks make Python think something is text

# Variables can be Boolean (True / False)
love_programming = True

print(greeting)
print(fav_num)
print (love_programming)

# This variable has a problem:
my_name = "Ethan"


print(fav_num * 2)
print(num_string * 5) 

# Constants are uppercase
PI = 3.14

a_01_my_num = 7
